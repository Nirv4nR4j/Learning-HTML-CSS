    <h1 style="color:#df2d4a; font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">What is Cybersecurity?</h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
       A cyber attack is any attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer, computing system or computer network with the intent
       to cause damage.<br>Cyber attacks aim to disable, disrupt, destroy or control computer systems or to alter, block, delete, manipulate
       or steal the data held within these systems. <br>A cyber attack can be launched from anywhere by any individual or group using one or 
       more various attack strategies.People who carry out cyber attacks<br>are generally regarded as cybercriminals. Often referred to as
       bad actors, threat actors and hackers, they include individuals who act alone, drawing on their<br>computer skills to design and execute 
       malicious attacks. They can also belong to a criminal syndicate, working with other threat actors to find weaknesses <br>or problems in the
       computer systems called vulnerabilities that, can be exploited for criminal gain. Government-sponsored groups of computer experts <br>also
       launch cyber attacks. They're identified as nation-state attackers, and they have been accused of attacking the information technology (IT)
       infrastructure <br>of other governments, as well as nongovernment entities, such as businesses, nonprofits and utilities.

      Why do CYBER ATTACKS happen?
    </h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
      Cyber attacks are designed to cause damage. They can have various objectives, including the following:<br><br>
      <strong>Financial gain:</strong> Most cyber attacks today, especially those against commercial entities, are launched by cybercriminals
      for financial gain. <br>These attacks often aim to steal sensitive data, such as customer credit card numbers or employee personal
      information, which the cybercriminals <br>then use to access money or goods using the victims' identities.
      Other financially motivated attacks are designed to disable the computer systems themselves, <br>with cybercriminals locking computers 
      so that their owners and authorized users cannot access the applications or data they need; attackers then demand that <br>the targeted
      organizations pay them ransoms to unlock the computer systems. Still other attacks aim to gain valuable corporate data, such as propriety
      information; <br>these types of cyber attacks are a modern, computerized form of corporate espionage.<br><br>
      <b>Disruption and revenge:</b> Bad actors also launch attacks specifically to sow chaos, confusion, discontent, frustration or mistrust. 
      They could be taking such action as <br>a way to get revenge for acts taken against them. They could be aiming to publicly embarrass the 
      attacked entities or to damage the organizations' reputation. These attacks <br>are often directed at government entities but can also hit 
      commercial entities or nonprofit organizations. Nation-state attackers are behind some of these types of attacks. Others, <br>called hacktivists, might launch these types of attacks as a 
      form of protest against the targeted entity; a secretive decentralized group of internationalist activists known as <br>Anonymous is the most
      well known of such groups. Insider threats are attacks that come from employees with malicious intent.<br><br><b>Cyberwarfare:</b> Governments around the world are also involved in cyber attacks, with many national governments acknowledging or suspected 
      of designing and executing attacks <br>against other countries as part of ongoing political, economic and social disputes. These types of attacks
      are classified as cyberwarfare.

      8 Types of Cyber attack
    </h1>
    <dl>
      <dt style="color:#df2d4a;font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
        Malware
      </dt>
      <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
        - Short for malicious software, malware can refer to any kind of software,
        no matter how it's structured or operated, that "is a designed to cause 
        damage <br>to a single computer, server, or computer network," as Microsoft puts
        it. Worms, viruses, and trojans are all varieties of malware, distinguished
        from one <br>another by the means by which they reproduce and spread. These 
        attacks may render the computer or network inoperable, or grant the attacker
        root <br>access so they can control the system remotely.

          Ransomware
        </dt>
        <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          - Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts a victim's files. The attacker then demands a ransom from the victim to 
          restore access to the data <br>upon payment. Users are shown instructions for how to pay a fee to get the decryption key. 
          The costs can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, <br>and are typically payable to cybercriminals in cyptocurrency.

          Phishing
        </dt>
        <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          - Phishing is a technique by which cybercriminals craft emails to fool a target into taking some harmful action. 
          The recipient might be tricked into downloading <br>malware that's disguised as an important document, for instance, 
          or urged to click on a link that takes them to a fake website where they'll be asked for sensitive information <br>like 
          bank usernames and passwords. Many phishing emails are relatively crude and emailed to thousands of potential victims, 
          but some are specifically crafted for valuable target <br>individuals to try to get them to part with useful information.
        </dd><br><br>

        <dt style="color:#df2d4a;font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          Distributed denial of service(DDOS)/Denial of service(DOS)
        </dt>
        <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          - A denial of service attack is a brute force method to try stop some online service from working properly. 
          For instance, attackers might send so much traffic to a <br>website or so many requests to a database that it 
          overwhelms those systems ability to function, making them unavailable to anybody. A distributed denial of service (DDoS)
          attack uses <br>an army of computers, usually compromised by malware and under the control of cybercriminals, to funnel the 
          traffic towards the targets.

          Man in the middle
        </dt>
        <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          - A man in the middle attack (MITM) is a method by which attackers manage to interpose themselves secretly between the user 
          and a web service they're trying to access. For instance, <br>an attacker might set up a Wi-Fi network with a login screen designed 
          to mimic a hotel network; once a user logs in, the attacker can harvest any information that user sends, including <br>banking passwords.

          Cryptojacking
        </dt>
        <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          - Cryptojacking is a specialized attack that involves getting someone else's computer to do the work of generating cryptocurrency
          for you (a process called mining in crypto lingo). <br>The attackers will either install malware on the victim's computer to perform 
          the necessary calculations, or sometimes run the code in JavaScript that executes in the victim's browser.

          SQL Injection
        </dt>
        <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          - SQL injection is a means by which an attacker can exploit a vulnerability to take control of a victim's database. Many databases
          are designed to obey commands written in the <br>Structured Query Language (SQL), and many websites that take information from users 
          send that data to SQL databases. In a SQL injection attack, a hacker will, for instance, <br>write some SQL commands into a web form 
          that's asking for name and address information; if the web site and database aren't programmed correctly, the database might try 
          to execute <br>those commands.

          Zero-day exploits
        </dt>
        <dd style="font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif;">
          - Zero-days are vulnerabilities in software that have yet to be fixed. The name arises because once a patch is released, 
          each day represents fewer and fewer computers open to attack as users <br>download their security updates.  Techniques for exploiting 
          such vulnerabilites are often bought and sold on the dark web — and are sometimes discovered by government agencies that <br>controversially 
          may use them for their own hacking purposes, rather than releasing information about them for the common benefit.
